# Introduction
}}
Welcome to "Shadows of Neverwinter Wood," an adventure that pits heroes against the insidious Red Wizards of Thay and their multi-layered schemes.

This adventure is designed for three to six 1st-level characters but can be easily adapted for parties starting from the 5th level. The catastrophic events leading to the current crisis are established facts within the campaign's narrative, setting the stage for the unfolding plot. The ultimate fate of *Neverwinter*, however, remains in the hands of the players. 
In the "Adventure Overview" section, we briefly outline the events that set this grand scheme into motion. In subsequent chapters,we describe the story so far, then outline major geographic locations and factions and finally, for each area provide possible encounters. 

## Adventure Overview
A disastrous arcane calamity occurs within the *Sword Mountains*, where the land trade route *Neverwinter* relies on is blocked by planar instability, wild magic and extraplanar monsters. 

The *Red Wizards of Thay* orchestrate a dark scheme deep within the ancient woods near the city of *Neverwinter*. Their plan involves harvesting the precious Sussur wood from a sacred grove known only to a small clan of wood elves and the druids of the *Emerald Circle*, valuable for both arcane use and crafting powerful artifacts.  
At the same time, to distract possible opponents - *Lord Nasher*, the ruler of *Neverwinter* and the *Harpers*, the *Red Wizards* have begun to incite a popular rebellion within the city walls: by using locally hired provocators and staging faux attacks by wood elves on trade caravans, they have not only disrupted the cityâ€™s lifeline but also fueled unrest among the populace as supply shortage begins to drive prices up. With sea trade halted by winter storms, *Neverwinter* faces a crisis that the *Red Wizards* hope to use to their advantage - whether to weaken the city's defenses or to seize control by installing a puppet ruler.
After a series of failed attempts by the *Neverwinter Graycloaks* to apprehend the bandits, a prominent Neverwinter merchant decides to hire heroes in a desperate attempt to prevent a possible uprising.

In this section, you will find the essential background information needed to understand the geopolitical and environmental stakes that are pivotal to your campaign. The details provided will help you create a rich narrative experience, enabling you to weave complex plots and subplots that are responsive to your players' actions and decisions.

## Neverwinter
Nestled on the northwestern coast of FaerÃ»n, the cosmopolitan city of Neverwinter is often hailed as 'The Jewel of the North.' It is renowned for its skilled craftsfolk, meticulous gardeners, and the uniquely warm waters that flow beneath its streets, heated by fire elementals dwelling beneath a nearby volcano. As winter tightens its icy grip, however, the elemental warmth that protects the city and its harbor falters at the borders, leaving the surrounding seas perilous. Fierce storms from the Sea of Moving Ice make naval routes almost impassable without the aid of costly weather magesâ€”a luxury few can afford.

With the sea allowing travel only in the short summer months, Neverwinterâ€™s lifeline in the frost-bound months is the High Road, a vital land artery that carves through the Sword Mountains. Trade caravans traversing this route are critical, bringing essential supplies, including foodstuffs sorely lacking in Neverwinter. While the city's fire elementals provide warmth, there is not enough heated land to sustain the agriculture needed to feed its burgeoning population. Hunting provides some relief, but it cannot sustain the bustling metropolis on its own.

This dependency sets the stage for our adventure. Should anything threaten to sever these crucial land trade routes, like a calamity of some sort, the consequences for Neverwinter could be catastrophic, straining its economy to the breaking point and pushing its people toward desperation.{{watercolor3,top:420px,left:500px,width:330px,opacity:22%}}

## The Calamity
Little more than two years ago, the tranquility of the *Sword Mountains* was shattered by an arcane explosion of colossal proportions. This disaster not only obliterated sections of the *High Road*, covering it with rubble and half-melted rock but also transformed the area into a desolate zone now known as the "*Arcane Wastes*".

The origin of this catastrophe was far from natural. High in the mountains, scouts from *Clan Forgebar*, led by the ambitious priest *Dunstun Forgebar*, discovered an ancient red dragon slumbering amidst a vast treasure trove. While the dwarves initially avoided disturbing the dragon, Dunstun saw a dual threat and opportunity, convincing his clan and nearby dwarven and gnomish communities to eliminate the dragon for the safety of all.

Their collective attempt led to a stalemate, and in a climactic confrontation, a massive arcane explosion ensued, decimating the attackers, the dragon, and its hoard. The exact cause remains uncertain - was it a protective enchantment, a misfired spell by a dwarven mage, or the dragon's final act of defiance? The truth is buried under the mountain rubble, obscured by ongoing planar rifts, monstrous incursions, and arcane anomalies that plague the area.

### Arcane Wastes
The Arcane Wastes, a blighted region where the fabric of magic has been torn asunder, have become infamous for their wild magic and planar instability. In this desolate landscape, the Weave - the underlying source of all magic in the world - is in constant flux, causing spells to malfunction or produce unpredictable effects.

### The Anomalies
The unpredictable nature of magic in the Arcane Wastes is a peril to any spellcaster. Mages and other arcane casters find their spells might unleash effects vastly different from what was intended, turning simple magical efforts into chaotic, and sometimes dangerous, outcomes. For instance, a basic *firebolt* could erupt as a wild surge, summoning a creature from another plane, or enveloping the caster in a brief, but harmless, bubble of force.
{{tome 
A comprehensive table for rolling the effects of the wild magic and arcane anomaly area effects will be provided in the **Running the Adventure** section 
}}
### Extraplanar Monsters
The Arcane Wastes, having become a cruicible of chaotic energies, attract a host of bizarre creatures, each drawn by different aspects of the regionâ€™s instability. Quasits, malevolent fiends from the Lower Planes, thrive amidst the wild magical fluctuations, enjoying attacking anything resembling prey for their own twisted enjoyment. The Slaadi from the Plane of Limbo are enticed by the the possible battles with denizens of the material plane, allowing them to unleash their inherently destructive natures. Another group, the methodical Githyanki warriors, are often seen scouting and exploring the landscape.


{{wide
### Alternate Trade Route

Shortly after the calamity, with the High Road rendered perilous, a new trade route was carved through the foreboding Neverwinter Wood, tracing the meandering Neverwinter River towards Longsaddle. This path, less traveled and more treacherous than the High Road, quickly became essential. Bandit skirmishes and monster attacks are frequent, demanding constant vigilance from travelers and necessitating heavily guarded merchant caravans.
Despite these perils, the combination of brave adventurers and experienced guards has maintained relative safety, preserving the vital flow of supplies. This necessity-driven traffic has unexpectedly prospered Longsaddle. The town, once quiet and unremarkable, now thrives as a pivotal trade hub, bustling with activity and growing wealth from increased caravan tolls.

\column

### Refugee Crisis
Initially, the resilient inhabitants of the Sword Mountains managed to withstand the arcane instability plaguing their land. They even repelled several attacks from extraplanar invaders. However, their time was running out. The majority of their warriors had perished in a devastating conflict with a dragon, leaving only fragmented clan militias to defend their homes. As the situation deteriorated and horrifying attacks by Slaadi began decimating more settlements, the dwarves and gnomes, once thriving in these remote highlands, were compelled to flee. Their exodus varied: those from the northern reaches headed north, while southern inhabitants migrated southward, guided by familial ties, trade relationships, and geographic convenience.

#### Refugees in Waterdeep
Drawn to Waterdeep, the City of Splendors, many refugees sought new beginnings amidst its bustling economy and historical receptivity to diverse peoples. The cityâ€™s thriving guilds presented numerous employment opportunities, especially in fields like craftsmanship and engineering, where dwarf and gnome skills were in high demand. However, integration proved challenging amid the cityâ€™s intricate politics and the fierce competition within its guilds, leaving some refugees struggling to find the stability they had hoped for.

#### Refugees in Neverwinter
Meanwhile, Neverwinter, celebrated for its craftsfolk and economic stability, also emerged as a primary refuge for the displaced. Lord Nasher, recognizing the value of skilled artisans, endeavored to assimilate the dwarves and gnomes into the community by initiating new construction projects. Nevertheless, his efforts were met with significant political resistance from local guilds, wary of the competition posed by the newcomers' formidable talents.

#### Refugees in Silverymoon
A smaller group of refugees chose Silverymoon, the "Gem of the North," attracted by its strong magical traditions and scholarly atmosphere. Particularly appealing to gnomes versed in the arcane, Silverymoonâ€™s inclusive policies and the esteemed University of Silverymoon offered a sanctuary for those seeking a tranquil life devoted to study and innovation.

## A Devious Plan

&nbsp;It all began with a surprising revelation: a routine scrying session unveiled a grove of Sussur trees within the easily accessible bounds of the Neverwinter Woodâ€”trees previously believed to grow only in the perilous Underdark. Abdel-ibn Wazir, the Thayan ambassador in Neverwinter, a lowborn but extremely ambitious wizard, recognized a rare opportunity to ascend within the ranks of the Red Wizards. A steady supply of Sussur bark and timber would enable the creation of numerous powerful artifacts, strengthening the martial and arcane potential of their country.

However, Abdel discovered an unexpected issue with this design. Revered by the local wood elves and zealously protected by the druids of the Emerald Circle, the Sussur trees posed a significant challenge due to the anti-magic fields surrounding them. To avoid a potentially costly direct confrontation, Abdel enlisted Seraphim Fairwind, a young and ambitious scion of a notable trading family. Promised considerable profits from the sale of the magical wood, Seraphim was tasked with hiring mercenaries to defend the woodcutters from potential attacks by the wood elves and druids. Unbeknownst to Seraphim, many of these mercenaries were covertly bound by geas spells to ensure their absolute loyalty to Thayan interests.

With these pieces in place, the Red Wizards initiated a broader strategy to destabilize Neverwinter. Disguised as wood elves and augmented by Thayan agents, Seraphim's mercenaries launched numerous attacks on trade caravans traveling through Neverwinter Wood. These attacks, meticulously staged to mimic the known tactics of wood elves, sowed confusion and fear.

The city's militia, the Greycloaks, acting under directives from Lord Nasher, engaged vigorously but were consistently outmaneuvered. Suffering heavy losses, they were forced to make a strategic withdrawal to the safety of the city walls. This series of defeats left the trade routes perilously exposed, demoralizing the cityâ€™s defenders and inciting fear and unrest among the citizens.

As winter tightened its grip, rendering sea trade nearly impossible, these orchestrated disruptions led to critical food shortages. Thayan agents, seizing the opportunity, manipulated the growing despair to incite a popular uprising against the city's ruling class. From the shadows, Abdel observed the unfolding chaos, confident that whether they merely weakened Neverwinter's defenses or succeeded in installing a puppet ruler, the influence and power of the Red Wizards would be significantly enhanced.

## Sussur Trees
The Sussur trees within Neverwinter Wood stand as more than unique botanical specimens; they are poignant reminders of the Crown Warsâ€”a period marked by catastrophic magical warfare that tore apart the elven realms. These trees thrive on ambient arcane radiation, remnants of the High Magic once wielded during the wars, relying on this energy more than sunlight itself. This consumption of magical energies causes the trees to emit a natural anti-magic field extending 100 feet (30 meters) around them, serving as both protection and testament to their origins.

\column

### Historical Significance
During the Crown Wars, areas immune to rampant magical forces became sanctuaries. The Sussur trees, likely mutated into their current form due to exposure to High Magic, naturally nullified surrounding magic, making them invaluable during and after the conflicts. Recognized post-war as symbols of peace and magical restraint, efforts to preserve these trees intensified, championed by all who sought to prevent historyâ€™s dark chapters from repeating.

### Symbolism and Rituals
Annually, the wood elves of the Neverwinter Wood gather at the Sussur grove to perform ceremonies that honor their ancestors and the harsh lessons of the past. These rituals, rich with stories and vows of peace, reinforce the sacredness of the grove and educate the younger generations about the critical balance and caution necessary in magic use. These ceremonies not only connect the community but serve as a powerful reminder of the destructive potential of unchecked power.

### Valuable Commodity
Sussur wood can used to create an unusual type of paper, useful for creating powerful magic scrolls. Also, their tree bark possesses potent magical properties. If a skilled blacksmith burns it in the forge, it would produce blue flames and can be used to imbue powerful enchantments into the weapon.

# Geography
}}
 ![background image](https://i.imgur.com/93J6YBr.jpg)
This chapter provides detailed descriptions and sufficient information about key locations essential to the adventure, ensuring Dungeon Masters have everything needed to run the campaign. Given the vast expanse of Northwest FaerÃ»n, an exhaustive enumeration of all possible locales is beyond the scope of this chapter. For a more comprehensive exploration of the region, Dungeon Masters are encouraged to consult *Volo's Guide to the North* and *The North: Guide to the Savage Frontier*. These additional resources offer a wealth of locations and plot hooks that can enrich your campaign and enhance the experiences of your players.


## Overview
Before we delve into specific locations, let's take a broader look at the region. Northwest FaerÃ»n, often referred to as *the North* or *the Savage North* by those in the southern parts of FaerÃ»n, is a land of untamed wilderness, harsh winters, resilient folk, and formidable monsters. Unlike many other geographic regions, *the North* is difficult to define precisely; however, travelers and scholars generally agree on its boundaries. To the north, the region borders *the Frozenfar*, separated by the towering, desolate *Spine of the World*. To the west lies the vast *Anauroch Desert*, and to the south, the town of *Daggerford* marks the region's edge.

Despite the moniker 'savage' given by the southern folk of the continent, *the North* is far from a desolate and remote region. Three sprawling city-states, among the most populated and powerful in all of FaerÃ»n, are nestled along the Sword Coast, which marks the western border of the region. *Neverwinter*, the northernmost of the city-states, famed for its crafts and gardens, is the last bastion of civilization before the wide, snow-covered, untamed wilds of *the Frozenfar*. *Waterdeep*, often called "the City of Splendors," is a cosmopolitan metropolis, a hub of trade and culture, and the most influential and important city in *the North*, and perhaps in all of FaerÃ»n. *Silverymoon*, known also as "the Gem of the North," has a long tradition of arcane study and practice and is home to many notable sorcerers and wizards.

### Economics and Trade
*The North* is crisscrossed by vital trade routes that connect its city-states and settlements to the wider world. The High Road runs along the Sword Coast, linking *Neverwinter* to *Waterdeep* and further south to *Daggerford* and beyond. This well-traveled route is essential for the movement of goods and people, ensuring prosperity in the region. Another crucial artery is the Long Road, which stretches north from *Waterdeep* through *Triboar* and into the interior, facilitating trade with inland towns and villages.  

Sea trade is equally vital to the prosperity of the North. The bustling port of *Waterdeep* serves as the region's primary maritime gateway, with its deep harbor accommodating ships from across FaerÃ»n and beyond. Merchant vessels laden with goods from the southern cities and distant lands such as Amn and Calimshan regularly dock here, bringing exotic wares and returning with the North's finest crafts and resources. 

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote Geography }}

\page

*Neverwinter* boasts a significant port as well, benefiting from its ice-free harbor, kept usable even during the harshest winters by the geothermal warmth from nearby *Mount Hotenow*. This advantage allows for continuous trade with the *Moonshae Isles* and other northern coastal settlements. However, storms from the northern *Sea of Moving Ice* can make winter-time trade dangerous, often requiring the assistance of weather-controlling mages to ensure safe passage, a costly service that not all traders can afford.

The strategic location of ports along the Sword Coast supports robust trade networks, ensuring a steady flow of wealth and goods into the region. Each area within the North has its specialties: *Waterdeep* serves as a major hub for all kinds of goods due to its strategic location; *Neverwinter* is renowned for its high-quality crafts, timber from the *Neverwinter Wood*, and as a key trade center for Icewind Daleâ€™s gems and metals; *Silverymoon* exports magical items and scholarly works; and the towns around the *High Forest* also supply timber and wild game.

## The Frozenfar
We begin our journey of *the North* with the region of *the Frozenfar*, a remote area characterized by occasional patches of civilization amidst the frigid, untamed wilderness. But what exactly is this region? To the people living in *the North*, it is a cold, inhospitable area north of the *Spine of the World* mountains, encompassing the icebergs of the *Sea of Moving Ice*, the *Cold Run* tundra, the coast of the *Trackless Sea* and the ten towns of *Icewind Dale*. However, to many southerners, such as those from Amn, everything north of *Mirabar* is often referred to as *the Frozenfar*.

### Travel Mechanics
Survival in the *Frozenfar* should be challenging and test the resourcefulness of the adventurers. Here are some relevant survival mechanics Dungeon Masters should consider incorporating.

#### Extreme Cold
Characters exposed to the extreme cold of the Frozenfar region must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of each day of travel. On a failed save, a character gains one level of exhaustion. Characters equipped with cold weather gear or naturally adapted to cold climates have advantage on this saving throw. To streamline travel, consider distances and make multiple saving throws at once to avoid bogging down the pace of the campaign.

{{footnote Geography }}

\page


#### Limited Resources
**Food and Water:** The sparse vegetation and wildlife make food and water scarce. Characters need to forage or hunt to find sustenance. Foraging requires a successful DC 15 Survival check. Hunting wildlife, such as reindeer or elk, may require tracking (DC 15 Survival) and possibly a successful combat encounter, at the Dungeon Master's discretion.  
**Fire and Shelter:** Building a fire or finding shelter is critical. Without warmth, characters cannot benefit from long rests and must make additional Constitution saving throws against exhaustion. Finding suitable shelter or constructing a makeshift one requires a DC 15 Survival check.

#### Navigating the Terrain
The following mechanics may be incorporated during combat encounters in the *Frozenfar* wilderness.  

**Treacherous Ice:** Traveling across frozen rivers and icy patches requires a DC 12 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to avoid slipping and falling. Characters who fail this check fall prone and may take 1d4 bludgeoning damage if they fall on particularly hard ice.

**Blizzards and Whiteouts:** During a blizzard or whiteout, visibility is reduced to 10 feet, and all Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on sight are made with disadvantage. Additionally, moving through the snow requires double the movement speed, and characters must succeed on a DC 10 Survival check each hour to stay on course.


### DM Description Tips
In order to create an immersive experience in the *Frozenfar*, consider the following descriptive elements.

**Weather:** Emphasize the biting cold and relentless winds. Describe how the wind howls across the tundra, carrying stinging ice crystals that bite into exposed skin.

**Landscape:** Paint a picture of treacherous alpine mountain terrain (for areas closer to the *Spine of the World*) or snow-covered plains stretching as far as the eye can see, broken only by frozen rivers, sparse, hardy vegetation and occasional icy hillocks. Mention the crunch of snow underfoot and the treacherous ice patches hidden beneath the surface.

**Wildlife:** Frozen tundra may be a desolate place, but it doesn't mean it is lifeless. Highlight the presence of hardy wildlife adapted to the harsh environment. Describe the sight of a distant herd of reindeer moving across the plain, or the eerie howls of wolves echoing in the night. Mention tracks in the snow, hinting at the presence of elusive predators and perhaps tribes of barbarian hunters who recently passed there.

**Day and Night:** Contrast the stark, blinding whiteness of the arctic environment during the day with the deep, shadowy blues and blacks of the night. Mention how the sky changes, from clear, star-filled nights to the dim, oppressive overcast days.

**Survival:** Convey the harshness of survival in this environment. Describe the effort it takes to build a fire, the constant battle against the cold, and the importance of conserving supplies. Mention the physical and mental toll the environment takes on those who traverse it.

### Sea of Moving Ice
This sea is a vast, frozen expanse situated in the far north of FaerÃ»n. Known for its treacherous waters and massive, drifting icebergs, this region is as dangerous as it is awe-inspiring. The icebergs, some towering hundreds of feet above the waterline, are majestic yet menacing, often hiding deep cracks in the ice and deadly jagged edges beneath the surface. The area contains no population of note, but it is an ecosystem of its own. Seals, orcas, occasional water elementals, myriad birds, and larger sea beasts - or perhaps more accurately, aberrations like aboleths and sea krakens - can be encountered in this sea as well.

#### Landmarks
&nbsp;**Revel's End**: it is a remote, high-security prison located in the frigid expanse of the Frozenfar. Perched atop a desolate cliff overlooking the Sea of Moving Ice, this fortress is designed to hold the most dangerous criminals of the North. Its isolated location and harsh environment make escape nearly impossible. The prison is heavily fortified with thick stone walls, watchtowers, and a garrison of well-trained guards. Within its icy confines, inmates endure grueling conditions and strict discipline, ensuring that those who are sent to Revel's End rarely see freedom again.  
&nbsp;**Tower of the Ice Witch**: The looming, frost-covered tower nestled in the heart of the *Frozenfar* is the dwelling place of *Hedrun Arnsfirth*, the chosen of *Auril the Frost Maiden*. Sculpted from enchanted ice, the tower stands as a testament to the Ice Witch's formidable power. Its twisted spires and icy battlements are filled with dark magic and treacherous traps. Inside, the temperature drops to unbearable lows, and the corridors are haunted by spectral guardians and frigid horrors. The *Ice Witch* herself, a master of cold-based magic, commands the tower and its defenses, making it a perilous destination for any mortal daring enough to seek its secrets.

### The Cold Run
The Cold Run is a vast, desolate expanse north of the Spine of the World and south of the Sea of Moving Ice. This frigid tundra is characterized by relentless winds, freezing temperatures, and sparse vegetation. Snow-covered plains, frozen rivers, and occasional icy hillocks dominate the landscape, creating an environment where only the hardiest creatures and people can survive.

Despite its barren appearance, the Cold Run is home to a variety of wildlife adapted to extreme conditions. Herds of reindeer and elk roam the tundra, providing sustenance for predators such as wolves and the elusive polar bears. Seasonal migrations see these animals moving southward to escape the worst of winter's grip.

Permanent settlements are nonexistent in the Cold Run due to its unforgiving climate. However, nomadic tribes of Uthgardt barbarians and hardy dwarven prospectors occasionally traverse this icy wilderness, seeking game or valuable minerals hidden beneath the permafrost.

#### Landmarks
&nbsp;**Ironmaster**: *Ironmaster* is a reclusive dwarven city nestled in the western mountains of the *Cold Run*. The city's entrance is heavily guarded and hidden, known only to its inhabitants and a few trusted outsiders. It is renowned for its rich deposits of iron and other metals, making it a crucial resource for the dwarven communities of the North.  

**Iceflow River**: The *Iceflow* is a freezing, dangerous river with water flowing at high speeds, making it very hard to cross. Flowing from the *Spine of the World*, the river courses through a great gorge of ice. In the brief summers of the Frozenfar, huge ice boulders break off the walls of the gorge, plummeting into the Iceflow. These large ice chunks then move through the gorge and float out to the *Sea of Moving Ice*.

**Ten Trail**: The trail begins in the town of *Fireshear* and heads north through a pass along the *Spine of the World* as far as *Bryn Shander*. Travel through the *Ten Trail* is risky not only because of the low temperatures, but also due to threats from dangerous creatures, intelligent and not so much such as crag cats, orcs, yetis, and even white dragons. On its northern leg past the mountains, the trail is known as the *Caravan Trail* and leads up to the South Gate of *Bryn Shander* of the *Icewind Dale*. The mountain portion of the trail is almost impassable during the winter. At its highest elevation, the trail passes through the town of *Hundelstone*. South of the *Spine of the World*, the *Iron Trail* connects the *Ten Trail* to the city of *Ironmaster*, but that trail practically disappears during the winter. Further along its southern leg, the trail also connects to the Northern Means, which heads towards Luskan.

**Fireshear**: this mining town lays on the coast west of the *Iceflow river* at the southern end of the *Ten Trail*. It consists of stone buildings dug out of the rock, resembling igloos, which withstood the bitter coastal winds and heavy snows. Many homes feature deep cellars for storing food during harsh, unforgiving winters. Perched above cliffs with ramps leading to a shallow bay, *Fireshear*'s stone docks are unusable from late fall through early summer when the bay freezes over, a period known in the town as lock-in. The city relies heavily on imported food and raw materials.

&nbsp; **Auckney**:This fog-shrouded village, nestled near the Spine of the World, lies along the southern shore of Cold Run. Dominated by the small yet imposing Castle Auck, the fortress perches on an island in the harbor. Strong winds and dense fogs perpetually chill the village, and villagers sometimes hear eerie screams of a woman from the abandoned lighthouse at the edge of the village. Ruled by the Auck family for over 400 years, the castle houses the family, their steward, a few servants, and guards.

The village's population, roughly 200 residents, consists mainly of humans. A small gnome community, comprising a few families, worked diligently to be accepted by wary and somewhat xenophobic humans. Eventually, their perseverance has paid off, and they are now known for their exceptional work ethic. Surrounding the village are several farms, adding to the secluded and self-sustaining lifestyle, far removed from the bustling trade routes.


\column

**Svardborg**: A formidable frost giant stronghold, floats in the Sea of Moving Ice north of Cold Run. This imposing iceberg serves as the home of Jarl Storvald and his war band. A small fjord carved into the ice forms a dock for their longships. Within Svardborg's wooden halls also lie slave pens and an enslaved white dragon.

The stronghold lacks traditional fortifications, relying instead on its remote location for defense. Though their presence is not widely known, the frost giants of Svardborg frequently raid surrounding regions, particularly targeting the Moonshae Isles. These raids are driven by Jarl Storvald's obsession with finding the legendary Ring of Winter, a powerful artifact he believes will bring about the Age of Everlasting Ice.

### Reghed Glacier
&nbspReghed Glacier, a vast expanse of ice and snow, stretches across the northern mountaineous reaches of the Frozenfar, presenting a formidable barrier of crevasses and towering stone and ice formations. The glacierâ€™s relentless cold and shifting terrain make it a perilous place, challenging even the most experienced adventurers. Despite its harsh environment, the glacier is home to the nomadic Reghedmen tribes, who have adapted to its frigid conditions over generations.  


While the area is largely desolate, holds its own unique dangers and mysteries. Frost giants, white dragons, and other arctic creatures roam the icy expanse, and the ever-present threat of blizzards and crevasses hidden under the snow adds to the perils faced by those who venture here. The Reghedmen, divided into several clans, traverse the glacier following the migratory patterns of reindeer and other game, living in harmony with the frozen land.


#### Landmarks
&nbsp;**The Evermelt:** This subterranean hot spring is located within a cave at the base of the Reghed Glacier.  
This tranquil oasis of warmth in the unforgiving cold of the glacier, with its serene turquoise waters  
glittering like gold, is considered a holy place by the Reghedmen barbarians of lving in the area.

Despite its calm appearance, the waters of Evermelt contain a small undercurrent capable of pulling  
individuals beneath the surface. If captured by the current, adventurers would be pulled through  
a tunnel opening into the former lair of the white dragon Ingeloakastimizilian. Here, Dungeon Masters  
could decide to reward players for their exploration initiative by allowing them to find hidden treasures  
that were once part of the white dragon's hoard.

&nbsp;**Nomadic Camps:** Scattered across the glacier are the temporary camps of the Reghedmen tribes. These camps, consisting of sturdy tents and makeshift shelters, provide brief respite from the harsh conditions and are centers of trade and culture for the nomadic people.
